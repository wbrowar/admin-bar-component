- Updated dependencies and raised Node version to 22.

### Removed

    - `--admin-bar-bg-image`
      - Use `--admin-bar-bg` instead as it will be used in all areas where `--admin-bar-bg-image` was.


## 1.6.1 - 2025-07-04

## 1.6.0 - 2025-07-04

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This release includes some style-breaking changes. A few CSS variables have been removed and noted below. New CSS variables are added to the `public/admin-bar.css` file.

### Added
- Added new CSS variables to manage the backdrop-filter (`--admin-bar-bg-filter`) and background-image (`--admin-bar-bg-image`) properties.
- Added `--admin-bar-inset-size` to add space between Admin Bar Component and its container.
  - On the `block` axis it adds `inset-block`
  - On the `inline` axis it adds `margin-inline`

### Changed
- Admin Bar Component has been slightly redesigned by the following concepts:
  - Replaced the glassy effect with a different implementation.
  - Used border radius CSS variable to round the corners on the `<admin-bar>` element.
  - Gave `<admin-bar>` inset values.
  - If you prefer to go back to the previous design, set:
    - `--admin-bar-inset-size: 0;`
    - `--admin-bar-border-radius: 0;` (and then override it again for `<admin-bar-button>` elements)
- Width of `<admin-bar>` is no longer set to `100%` by default.
  - This fixes some issues that come up when `position: fixed;` on `<admin-bar>` elements.
- Re-ordered default styles to be alphabetic in related groups.

### Removed
- Removed the following CSS variables
  - `--admin-bar-backdrop-filter`
    - Use `--admin-bar-bg-filter` instead.
  - `--admin-bar-glass-bg`
    - Use `--admin-bar-bg-color` instead.
  - `--admin-bar-glass-thickness`
  - `--admin-bar-shadow`

> {warning} There seem to be some issues with this implementation of popover and anchor positioning in Safari Tech Preview 215. Will keep an eye on it and look for solutions to resolve the issues before the next release of Safari.

- Changed default CSS anchor position behavior to use `position-area` instead of `top/left` position properties.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `label-after` and `label-before` slots on `<admin-bar-button>` elements. This will be removed in a future major version.


## 1.3.0 - 2025-02-05

### Added
- Styled the scrollbars that appear on `<admin-bar>` and `<admin-bar-button>` popover elements.

### Changed
- Split padding on `<admin-bar-button>` and `<admin-bar-text>` elements into separate CSS Custom Properties, `--admin-bar-block-padding` and `--admin-bar-inline-padding`.

  - The `dl-content` prop on `<admin-bar-text>` elements generates a `<dl>` from a stringified JSON tuple (array with only 2 values).

### Changed
- `<admin-bar-button>` buttons are now set to `box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 100%`.

  - Setting this will not hurt, but it gives you more flexibility to specify padding in popover content.

### Changed
- Minor default color tweaks for higher color contrast.


## 1.1.1 - 2024-12-04

- Increased the opacity of text in the default `--admin-bar-color-text` value to improve color contrast on `<admin-bar-text>` elements.
- Removed the `--admin-bar-bg` CSS Custom Property by default. Setting this to a CSS background image or color will override all other color effects.

### Fixed
